# cosmic-languages
Initial languages prototypes.

## Initial requirements

* Python 3.9 (setup[https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html])
* pipenv (setup[https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today])

## Setting up

Once you have cloned this repo locally, you need to run `pipenv install` and a virtual environment
will be deployed with the dependecies needed.

## Running 

It's a simple as `python main.py`, which will get for you (and print on the command line) for now
(as of 07/29/2021) an extract of the lyrics of _Somebody That I Used To Know - by Gotye_.

## Testing

Run `pytest` and bundled tests will be executed.
